The Cité des Sciences in Tunis (CST) is a public institution dedicated to spreading scientific knowledge and fostering a culture of curiosity throughout Tunisia. Its mission is to make science accessible to everyone, especially the next generation of Tunisia, by sparking intellectual curiosity and helping them understand contemporary scientific and technological innovations. The CST focuses on engaging the public through education and new technological innovations. 

To achieve these goals, the CST employs a multidimensional strategy centered on interactivity, thematic diversity, and research-driven innovation. Visitors, regardless of age, are encouraged to explore, play, and interact with various modules designed to convey scientific messages. This approach creates a fun, engaging, and friendly environment where learning becomes a delightful experience.

The “Life and Man” pavilion is the largest permanent exhibition at the CST, showcasing the history and evolution of life on Earth. With 96 interactive points of interest, visitors can explore a wide range of content presented through panels (graphs, illustrations, and diagrams), models (objects and reproductions), scenographies (staged displays with specific settings), computer software (interactive applications), audiovisuals (films and multimedia), and mechanisms (electrical and mechanical devices).

Designed for a broad audience, especially for students in grade school, the pavilion communicates complex scientific ideas in a clear and captivating way with interactive elements, images, and videos. To enhance visitor engagement and boost attendance, the CST is introducing a new immersive module: “The Time Tunnel.”

The Time Tunnel offers visitors a journey through time, immersing them in the atmosphere of the primitive Earth, taking place approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Through this interactive experience, visitors witness key milestones in the evolution of life on Earth. This exhibit engages sight, sound, touch, and smell, allowing visitors to feel the rapid progression of life.

The CST recognizes the need to captivate its audience by utilizing the latest technological advancements. The Time Tunnel will incorporate 3D landscape simulations, augmented reality, computer vision, interactive walls and floors, and immersive sensory effects such as soundscapes, aromas, and dynamic lighting. These features aim to deepen understanding, evoke wonder, and sharpen curiosity in audiences of all ages. By seamlessly blending education with entertainment, the CST continues to inspire a lifelong love for science and discovery.

## Objectives
The goal of the Time Tunnel is to immerse visitors in the most significant moments of Earth’s evolutionary history, delivering a spectacular and unforgettable experience that inspires a deeper curiosity and enthusiasm for science and technology.
